            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I'm a software developer with a deep curiosity for technology, a background in Computing Science, AI, and Physics, and a genuine interest in world politics. I’m drawn to roles where I can use my skills to make a positive impact, especially in contexts as important as global security. I love learning and tackling complex problems, and I thrive when collaborating with people from all walks of life. Joining NATO’s Young Professionals Programme would be an incredible opportunity to grow and contribute in meaningful ways, working on challenges that shape the future for us all.</p>
